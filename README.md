# todolist-django
A Todo List made with Django

This project is being built following [Django To Do List App With User Registration & Login](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llbtoQTt4qw) from Dennis Ivy.

The main objective here is to learn (and fix) some Django foundations and how to integrate CSS and JS files with an app.
